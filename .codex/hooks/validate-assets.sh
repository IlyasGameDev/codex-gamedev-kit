# --- work from the project root ----------------------------------------------
# Every path below is repo-relative, so a hook invoked with a working directory
# that is not the repo root would silently read and write the WRONG TREE --
# returning a near-empty result instead of the session-recovery block, and
# creating stray trees such as docs/production/session-logs/ on write.
#
# PRECEDENCE IS LOAD-BEARING. A cwd that IS a project root carries real
# information and must win: a caller sitting inside another project means that
# project, not this one. Resolving to the script's own location first would
# override them. So, in order:
#   1. cwd holds project.yaml   -> cwd   (a project root)
#   2. cwd holds .codex/       -> cwd   (a project root not yet configured),
#      unless cwd is itself named .codex: a stray .codex/.codex/ would
#      make .codex/ a root, and the hooks would write .codex/production/
#   3. STUDIO_PROJECT_ROOT       -> that  (set by the studio adapter),
#      unless it names a .codex folder, for the same reason as rule 2
#   4. this script's location   -> <root>/.codex/hooks/../.. by construction
# Rule 4 always works and needs no environment at all; rules 1-2 stop it from
# overriding a caller that legitimately means somewhere else.
#
# NOT an upward search: that resolves a nested project to its parent's config.

# Codex PostToolUse hook: Validates asset files after Write/Edit
# Checks JSON validity of data files and, in Godot's assets/, naming conventions.
# Asset roots per engine: Godot assets/, Unity Assets/, Unreal Content/.
#
# Exit behavior:
#   exit 0 = success or advisory warnings only
#   exit 2 = build-breaking issue (a data file that is not valid JSON)
#
# A PostToolUse hook CANNOT block -- the write has already happened by the time
# this runs (see .codex/docs/hooks-reference/hook-input-schemas.md). The only
# question is who hears about it, and that is what the exit code selects:
#   exit 1 -> stderr goes to the USER only. Codex never sees it, so a JSON file
#             it just corrupted looks like it wrote cleanly and it moves on.
#   exit 2 -> stderr is fed back to CODEX as actionable feedback, so it can fix
#             the file it just wrote.
# Exiting 1 while printing "ERRORS (Blocking) ... fix before proceeding" would be
# a promise the hook cannot keep, delivered to the one party who cannot act on it.
